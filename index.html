				None of the art is my own; instead, it was made by these awesome people who released it for free:

					 is a product of the people at <a href="https://mobilegamegraphics.com/">Mobile Game Graphics</a>,
						and here is <a href="http://opengameart.org/users/mobile-game-graphics">their OpenGameArt page</a>;
						it was released under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPLv3 license</a>;
					</li>
					<li>the <a href="http://opengameart.org/content/samurai-animated">lovely main character</a> was made by
